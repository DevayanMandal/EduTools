Educational tools using TravelMapping data

Hey everyone! Our design project team thanks Prof Teresco for sharing the Travel Mapping Data files. These files reflect the work his previous semester's graduate students had done to implement the Algorithm Visualization of Map Data.

We'll try our best to implement the changes which our clients would like to see in this project this semester!
